    <title>Turf tracker map privacy policy</title>
  </head>
  <body>
<p>
    The Turf Tracker map application draws a map from data stored in Google Drive, Google Sheets, or both.
    The application authenticates users using the Google APIs Client Library for JavaScript.
    The Google user information is used only to authenticate with the Google Drive and/or Google Sheets APIs.
    The data used to draw the map is requested through Google APIs on each page load, and is never stored.
</p>
<p>
    The Turf Tracker map application may use a third party analytics tool like Google Analytics to learn how you are using the map, and how we can improve that experience. 
</p>
<p>
    We may also aggregate user information and perform statistical analyses of the collective behavior of our visitors, to  analyze how to improve our service. We may share this information with third parties (such as Google Analytics), but such aggregate information does not contain personal information other than IP addresses. In addition, we may compile and disclose aggregate information about our users for promotional or other purposes. For example, we might want to disclose that a certain percentage of our users are located within a particular geographic area or visit the site most frequently in the mornings.
